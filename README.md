# TrueFalseQuizApp

This is a basic True/False quiz app built as part of my Android development learning journey using Java. It follows the early project structure from the *Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide* book.

The app displays a series of questions and allows the user to answer them with **True** or **False** buttons. Users can navigate between questions using **Next** and **Previous** buttons.
